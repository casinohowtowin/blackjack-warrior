<h2>Blackjack Warrior Software Introduction</h2>
Blackjack Warrior is software produced to allow players to learn and master the strategy of the game. The software is designed to be used while playing a Blackjack game in an online casino. The software is based on a statistical algorithm that provides the best possible next move to a player. 

<h2>Cards counting software explanation</h2>
Card counting is considered cheating and is illegal in many casinos.

However, there are various card counting software and apps available online. Some of these software programs claim to help users practice and improve their card counting skills, while others claim to provide real-time assistance during actual casino play.

It is important to note that the use of card counting software or devices is illegal in many casinos and can lead to serious consequences, including being banned from the casino or facing legal action. It is always best to play fairly and ethically.

<h2>Blackjack Warrior Software Algorithm</h2>
There are two major factors analyzed and considered to make the best advice on the move: 
<ul>
<li>Number of points in the player’s hand </li>
<li>The value of the Dealer’s card</li>
</ul>
 The value of the dealer's open card is of great importance for the player's choice of actions in the game. It is not customary to turn over a dealer’s open card.

Blackjack Warrior will suggest one of the following moves:
<ul>
<li>Hit (H) - take another card</li>
<li>Stand (S) - stop</li>
<li>Double (D) - multiply the bet by two</li>
<li>Split (P) - split a pair and continue playing</li>
<li>Double or Stay (Ds) – if possible, double the bet or stop the game</li>
<li>Hit or Surrender (S/H) - surrender half-time (if the rules allow) or take another extra card</li>
<li>Hit or Split (H/S) - split the bet; double it after the split if possible. If the rules do not allow it, we take it into our hands.</li></ul>

<h2>Blackjack Warrior Software Interface</h2>

We have introduced three functional windows in the interface of the program:
<ul>
<li>ADVICE - The first window is "Advice” and its job is to suggest a move.
It allows a player to set the value of the dealer's open card, "Dealer card," and choose the value of his "Your hand" cards. Once it is done, a program will deliver the best suggestion for the next move to be taken.</li>

<li>ALGORITHM. The next window is the "Algorithm."
In the algorithm window, we added a chart that covers the algorithm of the Blackjack Warrior program. The player can find a hint for the next move at the intersection of the value of the dealer's open card which is represented horizontally and the player’s cards which are represented vertically.</li>

<li>RECOMMENDED CASINOS. The third window is "Recommended casinos."
In the "Recommended casinos" window, we added the best online casino options to play Blackjack while using the Blackjack Warrior software. We based the rating on many review websites that provide useful information about online casinos.</li></ul>

Please note that the Blackjack Warrior software does not and will not guarantee any wins. The software is should only be used for educational purposes and as a supplementary tool to learn and master the strategy for playing Blackjack. We strongly suggest playing and gambling responsibly.
